# PizzaSalesAnalysis
RFM and Segmentation analysis of Hypothetical Pizza Company

*Project Description* <br>
• Utilized Machine Learning methods/models to perform RFM analysis on the current product lines, assisted in product classification and cross-marketing initiatives, and increased sales of items that were in danger.<br>
• The RFM study assisted in determining which items, in terms of their pricing and sales volume, were at risk.<br>
• The segmentation study assisted in determining which pizza category/segment had the most profitability and sales, which, when combined with an upselling and cross-marketing plan, may have helped stabilize the erratic sales. <br>
• Since the prices hadn't changed since 2015, I ultimately forecasted the price of the pizzas in various categories by adjusting them with the inflation rate from 2015 to 2023.<br>
